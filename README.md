💡 My Approach
I started by creating a basic React app using Create React App. I built a search bar to take movie titles as input and used React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage the input and fetch data from the OMDb API. Once the user enters a search term, the app fetches matching movies and displays them in a card format showing the poster, title, and year. I used small components like MovieCard to keep the code organized and added simple CSS for styling. The goal was to make the UI clean, interactive, and easy to use
